> **Due: Wed. Jan 20th**

* Complete the [technical setup](../docs/tech_setup.md) through the section on configuring Git. Hold off on installing ssh keys or Python for now. If you hit snags, reach out on Slack for help.
* Review the [CLI cheatsheet][] and spend some time practicing navigation and file/directory creation and removal.
* Skim [The Unix Shell][] tutorial. **You do NOT have to do the exercises but you should type in the commands as you work through the narrative.**  It's fine to skip the *Loops* section.
