# Goals

* Read up on DataKit to understand its role in the newsroom and in our classroom.
* Learn and practice some Python fundamentals. We're assuming some comfort with these basics next class, so don't skimp on the Python learning!

## Read about DataKit

* [Poynter article](https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2019/data-journalism-solves-big-problems-but-its-an-organizational-mess-a-new-tool-from-the-ap-aims-to-fix-that/) on Datakit provides a nice overview
* [AP's DataKit: Helping Teams collaborate efficiently](https://www.rjionline.org/stories/ap-datakit-intro), by RJI, gets into more details on DataKit's origin story and capabilities.

## Python reading and practice

Work through the [Python Syntax Crash Course](/docs/python/python_syntax_crash_course.md) if you were absent or if we didn't complete it during class.

Read and work through the specified sections of Chapters 0-2 in [Automate the Boring Stuff][], 2nd Edition.

> Ignore the book's instructions on where to write code. You should use the standard `python` or `ipython` interactive shells and a text editor such as VS Code, as appropriate. See the [crash course](/docs/python/python_syntax_crash_course.md#choose-a-shell) for help on the interpreter.

* [Chapter 1 - Python Basics](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter1/)
* [Chapter 2 - Flow Control](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter2/)
