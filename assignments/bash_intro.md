## Tech setup

Complete any [technical setup](../docs/tech_setup.md) that we did not have time to complete in class. If you hit snags, reach out on Slack for help.

## Read and practice

Skim [The Unix Shell][] tutorial. **You do NOT have to do the exercises but you should type in the commands as you work through the narrative.**  It's fine to skip the *Loops* section.

## Play

> NOTE: Make sure you've completed the tech setup *before* starting this!!

 Play the [bashcrawl](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl) game. Follow the below steps to download the files and get started:

  * Open a Terminal (aka bash shell)
  * Navigate to your Desktop: `cd ~/Desktop`
  * Run this command: `git clone https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl`
  * Move into the game directory: `cd bashcrawl/entrance`
  * Begin the game by reading the instructions: `cat scroll`
