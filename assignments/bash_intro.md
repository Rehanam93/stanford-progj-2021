## Tech setup

Complete any [technical setup](../docs/tech_setup.md) that we did not have time to complete in class. If you hit snags, reach out on Slack for help.

## Read and practice

Skim [The Unix Shell][] tutorial. **You do NOT have to do the exercises but you should type in the commands as you work through the narrative.**  It's fine to skip the *Loops* section.

## Play

> Note, the lines below starting with a `#` sign are code comments. You do not need to execute these in the shell.
